# EggHatch Timer

**A Pokemon GBA-style timer where you're waiting for your egg to hatch.**

## The Concept

You're not just setting a timer. You're incubating an egg. The countdown is visualized as a wobbling pixel egg that hatches when time's up. Pure GBA Pokemon nostalgia.

## Core Features

### 1. Egg Hatch Visualization
- Pixel art egg that wobbles during countdown
- Wobble intensity increases as time runs low
- Satisfying hatch animation when timer completes

### 2. GBA Pixel Display
- Large 16-bit countdown with Press Start 2P font
- Classic Pokemon menu frame (teal borders, cream background)
- That authentic washed-out GBA color palette

### 3. Quick Incubation Presets
- "Quick Egg" (1 min) - common Pokemon
- "Rare Egg" (5 min) - starter tier
- "Legendary Egg" (10 min) - mythical patience
- "Pomodoro Egg" (25 min) - productivity mode

### 4. Retro Control Buttons
- Chunky pixel buttons: START / PAUSE / RESET
- GBA-style "A" and "B" button aesthetics
- Button press feedback with pixel animations

### 5. 8-Bit Sound Effects
- Chiptune beeps on button press
- Egg wobble sounds
- Triumphant hatch sound when complete
